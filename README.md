# Numerical Methods for Derivatives Pricing

This repository contains a few numerical methods applied to equity and credit derivatives pricing, using C++:

- Resolution of Black-Scholes PDE with finite difference method (using various numerical schemes)
- pricing of European and Asian options using Monte-Carlo with variance reduction techniques
- pricing of correlation options with Monte-Carlo (best-of, worst-of, average call)
- pricing of FTD CDS with Gaussian & Clayton copulas.

(No pricing libraries were used.)
