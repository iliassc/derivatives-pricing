# Numerical Methods for Derivatives Pricing in C++

This repository contains a few numerical methods applied to equity and credit derivatives pricing:

- Resolution of Black-Scholes PDE with finite difference method
- pricing of European and Asian options with Monte-Carlo using variance reduction techniques
- pricing of correlation options with Monte-Carlo (best-of, worst-of, average call)
- pricing of First-to-default CDS using Gaussian & Clayton copulas.

(No pricing libraries were used.)
